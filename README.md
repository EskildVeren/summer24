# Summer project 2024

## Project intro

This is my summer project for 2024. I dont know what it is yet, but it will be something to keep me entertained while im stuck in Trondheim this summer. I already have a few thoughts on what I want it to contain. I want to create a web application, where job inteviewers easily can see my work. This will require both a frontend and a backend.

For the frontend I will probably use react. This is because I am already familiar with react, but I want to keep o improving my skills. I am very unsure about the backend, but I want to either use mongoDB or postgres, depending on what my backend will require. This is because I want to explore both technologies. It will either be hosted in the cloudor by an old laptop.

I have a few thoughts on what the project may be. For one, it would be nice to be somethingthat can host my cv. I think that a blogsite might be suitable for this. I might just blog about food because that is what I am the most passionate about. While my food blogging might not be relevant for job interviews, I hope that I can impress some interviewers with the quality of my work. I dont think that giving them a great pasta recipe will hurt either.

## Update

I think I might want to create a html canvas poker game instead. This gives the opportunity to play around with the canvas element and maybe create some sort of backend with something AI-ish. I dont want to implement multiplayer, so this would make it more fun to play all alone. Got inspired when they player poker in How I Met Your Mother. Problem is that I need somewhere to blog about my game. Might have to create the website above first

## 11.06

I have decided that I want my app to contain a backend using Kotlin.
I also want to create a back end from the ground up, since I got an interest in back-end work during my bachelor project. Many comapnies I am interested in working for use Kotlin/Java for the backend, and I have been interested in trying Kotlin for a while now. In order to learn Kotlin, I wil create some miniprojects in this repo, such as a calculator app and a basic todo list.
